Esse quam videri

Audience participation
Sometimes I am asked...

AI literacy
  This is the worst this technology will ever be.
  Relentless progress.
  Impact across disciplines

When prophets and apostles speak of technology, it is in the context of agency
[also repentance!] If this, then that.

[AI will not be controlled by any single entity, gov't or corp.]
-> we all have a role to play.

A powerful image: the fork in the road

Connect with their compassion
Connect with their covenants

---------

wisdom and understanding

god knows all
don't confuse man's understanding with God's
god can give us wisdom and understanding
the scriptures teach us how to seek the lord's wisdom
wisdom from god helps us understand things we would not otherwise understand

---------

1. ai is not god, and cannot be god

2. use ai as a tool for good

3. invite leaders and citizens - and faith leaders - to align rapid ai developments and faith-based values.


spiritual connection
transparency
privacy and security
accountability

we will not grow spiritually if we allow ai to write our sacrament talks or seminary lessons.

it cannot replace individual preparation.

(it may be helpful to edit, translate, or similar)


blurring of truth and realness


ai in the context of faith

we're not afraid of ai
nor is it the answer to every problem
as we work hard, it can be a valuable tool to enhance but not replace our own efforts

the lds church is not primiarily a purveyor of information
source of His truth and love

AI cannot replace revelation of replace truth from god

HG should be able to testify to the truth of everything

"Trust God an repent, and you can still go to heaven"

Every blessing of the gospel is meant personally for you.
